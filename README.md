# TrainingTyping ðŸ–®

TrainingTyping is a minimalistic typing speed testing app built with React and TailwindCSS that highly inspired by [MonkeyType](https://www.monkeytype.com). The app allows users to test and improve their typing speed and accuracy. The app provides a user-friendly interface and intuitive feedback on typing performance.

- **Time Category**: Users can adjust typing duration to 15s, 30s, or 60s according to their preference.
- **Statistics**: The app displays statistics such as WPM/CPM, accuracy percentage, error percentage and total number of characters typed.
- **Watch Typing History**: Users can watch their previous typing history and access their performance.
- **Change Theme**: Users can change the theme of the app based on their preference from available theme palette.
